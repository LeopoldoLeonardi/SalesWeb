# Sales Web

This application was developed as a initial study of C#, Entity Framework and aspects of MVC programming, however it can be used for real application.

It consists in a sales team management with the division by areas and options to filter in a simple way that display all sales within a period or by groups, and display to the user sales by department.

The application contemplates actions to create news departments, sellers and sales. MySql was used to manage the database.
